/*
Once cake sent to us, bought back to package-center and next 2 days, we were not able to pick it.
However at the same day we were rounding near by package-center for few times.

While get back home, it was late and 2 days later we'd a cake with feet-smell.

Anyway, I guess a door-bell with QR-code reader that somehow
connected with smart phone [mqtt i used here] would be helpful for package owner.

For future idea, a packet box can build infront of door,
and order id [that you made order in ebay, amazon, aliexpress etc],
description may supplied to MQTT broker, and once QR-code scanned with
supplied order-id and description, the packet box door will open.
The postman will put the packet and close it.
